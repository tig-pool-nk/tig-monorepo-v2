# EVIDENCE 

THIS IS A TEMPLATE FOR EVIDENCE TO BE SUBMITTED IN SUPPORT OF A REQUEST FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR BREAKTHROUGH REWARDS

## OVERVIEW

- TIG TOKEN HOLDERS WILL VOTE ON WHETHER YOUR ALGORITHMIC METHOD IS ELIGIBLE FOR BREAKTHROUGH REWARDS

- TIG TOKEN HOLDERS ARE FREE TO VOTE AS THEY LIKE BUT HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT IF THEY WANT TO MAXIMISE THE VALUE OF THE TOKENS THAT THEY HOLD, THEN THEY SHOULD BE SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT ALGORITHIC METHODS THAT THEY VOTE AS ELIGIBLE WILL BE BOTH NOVEL AND INVENTIVE

- THE REASON WHY NOVELTY AND INVENTIVENESS ARE IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE PREREQUISITES OF PATENTATBILITY.

- **THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT IS TO:**
  - CAPTURE A DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHMIC METHOD THAT YOU WANT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR ELIGIBILTY.

  - TO IDENTIFY THE CREATOR OF THE ALGORITHMIC METHOD.

  - TO PROMPT YOU TO PROVIDE THE BEST EVIDNCE TO SUPPORT THE CASE THAT THE ALGORITHMIC METHOD IS NOVEL AND INVENTIVE.

  - TO PROMPT YOU TO PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS OF YOUR ALGORITHMIC METHOD WHERE YIOU CAN.

WHEN PROVIDING EVIDENCE, YOU MAY CITE LINKS TO EXTERNAL DATA SOURCES.

## NOVELTY AND INVENTIVENESS

To support your claim that an algorithmic method is novel and inventive, you should provide evidence that demonstrates both its uniqueness (novelty) and its non-obviousness (inventiveness) in relation to the existing state of the art.

### Establish the State of the Art

- **Prior Art Search:** Conduct a comprehensive review of existing methods, algorithms, patents, academic papers, and industry practices to identify prior art in the domain.
  - Highlight documents and technologies most closely related to your method.

    > YOUR RESPONSE HERE

  - Show where these existing methods fall short or lack the features your algorithmic method provides.
  
    > YOUR RESPONSE HERE

- **Technical Context:** Describe the common approaches and challenges in the field prior to your innovation.

    > YOUR RESPONSE HERE

### Evidence of Novelty

- **Unique Features:** List the features, mechanisms, or aspects of your algorithmic method that are absent in prior art.

  > YOUR RESPONSE HERE
    
- **New Problem Solved:** Describe how your algorithmic method provides a novel solution to an existing problem.

  > YOUR RESPONSE HERE
    
- **Comparative Analysis:** Use a side-by-side comparison table to highlight the differences between your method and similar existing methods, clearly showing whatâ€™s new.
