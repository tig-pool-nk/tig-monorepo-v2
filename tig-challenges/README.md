# tig-challenges

A Rust crate that contains the implementation of TIG's challenges (computational problems adapted for proof-of-work).

Presently, TIG features four challenges:
1. [Boolean satisfiability](../docs/challenges/satisfiability.md)
2. [Capacitated vehicle routing](../docs/challenges/vehicle_routing.md)
3. [Knapsack problem](../docs/challenges/knapsack.md)
4. [Vector range search](../docs/challenges/vector_search.md)

Over the coming year, an additional seven challenges from domains including artificial intelligence, biology, medicine, and climate science will be phased in.
